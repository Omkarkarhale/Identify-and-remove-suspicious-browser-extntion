## 🔧 Steps to Audit Your Browser Extensions

1. **Open Your Browser’s Extensions/Add-ons Manager**
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:addons`

2. **Review All Installed Extensions Carefully**
   - Look for unfamiliar or suspicious names.
   - Pay attention to extensions you don’t remember installing.

3. **Check Permissions and Reviews**
   - Click on “Details” to see what data the extension can access.
   - Check the Chrome Web Store for user reviews or complaints.

4. **Identify Unused or Suspicious Extensions**
   - Focus on extensions that request excessive permissions or have negative feedback.

5. **Remove Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions**
   - Uninstall directly from your browser’s extension manager.

6. **Restart Browser and Monitor Performance**
   - You may notice faster loading, less memory usage, or fewer pop-ups.

7. **Research the Risks of Malicious Extensions**
   - Learn how extensions can steal data, redirect searches, or inject ads.

8. **Document Your Cleanup Process**
   - Keep a record of what you removed and why.
